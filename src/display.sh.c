 * What to sayâ€¯? The three functions are used to display informations. They can
 * be redeclared in the config file.
 * Update [2011/02/11]: We broke compatibility with some Crux scripts by
 *   changing those functions. Compatibility had problems before because 
 *   of the colors which were not present in pkgmk, but now, nothing parsing
 *   the output of pkgmk should work with pkg++ if no configuration has 
 *   been done to avoid it. I [Lukc] hope this modification will open
 *   a new era of peace and prosperity on pkg++, and a little more fun
 *   to packaging.
