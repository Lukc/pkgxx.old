#<
# # Include for Python distutils
# 
# This include declares a `build()` function if none has been declared.
# This function will try to run a `setup.py` script in a given
# directory of the sources to build a Python software and install it.
# 
# ## Important variables
# 
# * $dirname can be set to the directory in which the setup.py script
#   can be found and run. It defaults to `$name-$version` for stable
#   `$version`s and to `$name` for unstable ones.
# * $python can be set to the name of the Python interpreter to use to 
#   run the setup.py script. Usually, it should contain `python2` or
#   `python3`, with maybe a more precise version if needed. It defaults
#   to `python`.
# * `${build_opts[]}` is passed as options to the setup.py script after
#   the parameter “build”.
# * `${install_opts[]}` is similar to `${build_opts[]}`, except it is 
#   given after the `install`, the `--root=` and the `--prefix=`
#   parameters.
