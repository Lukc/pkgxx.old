# # Include for the Freedesktop.org server
# 
# The `freedesktop.org` include defines the `${source[]}` of a software which
# sources are on a freedesktop server.
# 
# ## Important variables
# 
#   * `$freedesktop_name` sets the name of the project on Freedesktop. It
#     also defines the sub-domain of the project on `freedesktop.org`. Its
#     default value is `$name`.
#     eg. `freedesktop_name=foo` will add a source which URL begins by
#     `http://foo.freedesktop.org`.
#   * `$freedesktop_extension` sets the extension of the tarball. Its 
#     default value is `.tar.gz`.
#   * `$freedesktop_version` can be used if the version of the tarball
#     on the server does not match `$version`. Its default value
#     is `$version`.
# 
# ## TODO
#
# This include may have to be updated. Additionally, `$lastver` is not
# declared if missing.
