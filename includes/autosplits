# ## Deprecated include: autosplits
# 
# This module is deprecated and no more documentation is available
# outside the git repository because it was never released in
# any stable version, and was removed soon in the unstable branch
# (pkg++ 0.13.1 was released without it).
# 
# Automatic splits are now managed internally and using includes
# is not required anymore.
