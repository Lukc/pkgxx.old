# # freedesktop include
#
# This include gives tools to allow easily following Freedesktop 
# specifications.
# 
# If you want to get the source and the last version of a software
# on a Freedesktop server, use the `freedesktop.org` include.
# 
# ## Important variables
# 
# * `$menudir` is a variable currently used only in the `freedesktop`
#   include. Is defines the directory in which the `.desktop` files
#   will be created. It defaults to `$sharedir/applications`.
# 
# ## Available functions
# 
# This in the list of all available functions provided by this include.

	#<
	# ### `make_desktop_entry()`
	# 
	# Function that helps to create `.desktop` files, usually in 
	# `$sharedir/applications/`. Set `$menudir` to change this 
	# directory.
	# 
	# `make_desktop_entry()` requires at least one parameter to
	# work, which is the name of the executable to be summoned 
	# by the applications using the `.desktop` files.
	#
	# However, it is highly recommended to also give a correct
	# Freedesktop category as second parameter. A list of
	# categories is also possible, as long as Freedesktop.org’s
	# syntax it respected.
	# 
	# The optional third parameter is the “real” name of the
	# application, if it differs from the executable name.
	# 
	# The fourth option is the icon of the application.
