0.12:
	* -lt,-gt,-le,-ge,-eq,-ne are now supported by vercmp() (and so by @{
	  }@). In more, -sb has been added, which is equivalent to ~>.
	* Problems of directories path in includes/cmake have been resolved.
	* Several minor documentation updates have been performed.
	* The experimental dependencies check is not run anymore when pkg++
	  does not plan to build a package.
	* The script-generated Makefile now creates the
	  /var/cache/pkg++/sources and /var/cache/pkg++/packages directories,
	  so that pkg++ is directly usable after a fresh installation.

0.11.6:
	* info(), warning() and error() updated to display all options given.
	* subinfo() added to print messages from inside recipe-defined
	  functions (build(), check(), etc.) and from modules at usefull times
	  (check_depends(), build(), etc.).
	* PKGMK_RPM_IGNORE_DISTEPOCH added to help avoid problems with the 
	  "distepoch" and "disttag" variables of some distributions of RPM.
	* Gentoo added to the list of known distributions.

0.11.5:
	* Revision numbers are available with Mercurial (hg) repositories.
	* ${supports[]} now uses a USE-like syntax.
	* defaults/prefixes becomes post-defaults/prefixes.zsh
	* @{ does not use die() anymore.
	* istrue() has been replaced by a C tool of the same function, name
	  and use.
	* $PKGMK_HOMEPREFIX can be set if pkg++ is used to build packages
	  in a user directory (eg. ~/, ~/.local, etc.). It exports the 
	  required variables to avoid having dependencies problems.

0.11.4:
	* Mainly documentation updates and bug corrections.

0.11.3:
	* $pkgname added. It allows changing the package name without changing
	  the recipe name.
	* ${supports[]} added. It currently allows disabling automated
	  cross-compiling tools if it does not contain "cross".
	* $class added.
	* includes/autotools uses ${supports[]}

0.11.2:
	* Use flags definitions have been remade. Each use flag is now defined in
	  a defaults file. They can also have a default enable or disable value,
	  defined in the same place.
	* pkg++ -cp says that everything is in order when nothing bad is to
	  report about the checked recipe.
	* use() now manages unknown flags, and if no information about it’s enable
	  or disable status is found, returns 2, instead of 1.
	* The ./configure supports two new options:
		* -d or --dist, to build distribution tarballs in gzip, bzip2 or xz.
		* -D or --clean-dist, to remove those tarballs and the temporary
		  directory created to build the tarballs.
	* A version comparator has been added, vercmp().
	* @{ is a new function also added to compare versions in a much
	  stricter way, doing some checks on it’s opts before trying to
	  compare anything.
	* A last version getter has been added, lastver(), which use vercmp().
	* The test/Makefile now runs only the pkg++ API tools and not the build
	  tests, except if explicitly asked by asking to build “nano” or “build”.
	* Test suites have been added in the test/directory:
		* getters
		* use
		* vercmp
		* targets
	* A correction in modules/dpkg has been made to avoid failures when $name
	  contains “_”.
	* The way recipes are managed deeply changed. For that reason, the
	  rockspecs support has been quickly added and the PKGBUILDs/FrugalBuilds
	  support has been lost (though we are still working on fixing it).
	* depname() has been added, for package managers’ module’s maintainers.
	  It should allow defining versions of dependencies (and conflicts,
	  and replacements, and so on) without breaking package managers that
	  do not manage versions.
	* The shell function which() which is embedded in pkg++ has been
	  corrected (yeah, before, we had a buggy which()).
	* info(), warning() and error() have been modified to be more fun.
	* The ./config.sh file at the root of the repository has been renamed
	  ./userland.zsh. This has been done because of ./distributions.zsh,
	  which was already present and generates in the Makefile
	  defaults/distributions. So, it should not change anything for the
	  user.

0.11.1:
	* New variable available for packagers, PKGMK_PORT.
	  This variable gives the repertory where the port is. So inclusions 
	  of port-specific files is now possible. (for exemple, a script under
	  a different license or common code to recipes with only different 
	  versions)
	* A begin of revision-in-version-number implementation is made. It 
	  does not work with every package manager or SCM.
	* $CROSS is now a usable boolean. It also should be now set to true
	  only when the triplet zsh was built with is different from the one 
	  in $CHOST. Before, it was set to true when $CHOST was non-zero.
	* Small improvements in modules/dpkg:
		* Internal modification leading to a module that should be easier
		  to maintain.
		* Conflicts are now managed.

0.11:
	* A beginning of implementation of scripts in Pkgfile’s functions has
	  been made.
	* Blank lines are removed in the output file of cpp “pkg++”. It is not
	  really noticeable concerning size of the file, but there is no more
	  20 blank lines and things like that…

	-- Lukc <lukc@upyum.com>

0.10.2:
	* Corrections of the manual pages which still contained references to
	  pkgmk.
	* The zcompile instruction was broken and has been corrected in the
	  ./configure generated Makefile.
	* The default configuration has been ported from bash to zsh, which has
	  not been done before…

	-- Lukc <lukc@upyum.com>

0.10.1:
	* Correction of a bug that caused architectures to be not written
	  in some packages.
	* Some splits problems with empty split_* variables are solved and
	  splits are more or less working again.
	* Minor documentation updates.

	-- Lukc <lukc@upyum.com>

0.10:
	* bash is replaced by zsh.

	-- Lukc <lukc@upyum.com>

0.1-0.10:
	No Changelog was maintained until 0.10.
