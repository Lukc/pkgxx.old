0.11.2:
	* Use flags definitions have been remade. Each use flag is now defined in
	  a defaults file. They can also have a default enable or disable value,
	  defined in the same place.
	* use() now manages unknown flags, and if no information about it’s enable
	  or disable status is found, returns 2, instead of 1.
	* The ./configure supports two new options:
		* -d or --dist, to build distribution tarballs in gzip, bzip2 or xz.
		* -D or --clean-dist, to remove those tarballs and the temporary
		  directory created to build the tarballs.
	* A version comparator has been added, vercmp().
	* @{ is a new function also added to compare versions in a much
	  stricter way, doing some checks on it’s opts before trying to
	  compare anything.
	* A last version getter has been added, lastver(), which use vercmp().
	* The test/Makefile now runs only the pkg++ API tools and not the build
	  tests, except if explicitly asked by asking to build “nano” or “build”.
	* Test suites have been added in the test/directory:
		* getters
		* use
		* vercmp
		* targets
	* A correction in modules/dpkg has been made to avoid failures when $name
	  contains “_”.
	* The way recipes are managed deeply changed. For that reason, the
	  rockspecs support has been quickly added and the PKGBUILDs/FrugalBuilds
	  support has been lost (though we are still working on fixing it).
	* depname() has been added, for package managers’ module’s maintainers.
	  It should allow defining versions of dependencies (and conflicts,
	  and replacements, and so on) without breaking package managers that
	  do not manage versions.

0.11.1:
	* New variable available for packagers, PKGMK_PORT.
	  This variable gives the repertory where the port is. So inclusions 
	  of port-specific files is now possible. (for exemple, a script under
	  a different license or common code to recipes with only different 
	  versions)
	* A begin of revision-in-version-number implementation is made. It 
	  does not work with every package manager or SCM.
	* $CROSS is now a usable boolean. It also should be now set to true
	  only when the triplet zsh was built with is different from the one 
	  in $CHOST. Before, it was set to true when $CHOST was non-zero.
	* Small improvements in modules/dpkg:
		* Internal modification leading to a module that should be easier
		  to maintain.
		* Conflicts are now managed.

0.11:
	* A beginning of implementation of scripts in Pkgfile’s functions has
	  been made.
	* Blank lines are removed in the output file of cpp “pkg++”. It is not
	  really noticeable concerning size of the file, but there is no more
	  20 blank lines and things like that…

0.10.2:
	* Corrections of the manual pages which still contained references to
	  pkgmk.
	* The zcompile instruction was broken and has been corrected in the
	  ./configure generated Makefile.
	* The default configuration has been ported from bash to zsh, which has
	  not been done before…

0.10.1:
	* Correction of a bug that caused architectures to be not written
	  in some packages.
	* Some splits problems with empty split_* variables are solved and
	  splits are more or less working again.
	* Minor documentation updates.

0.10:
	* bash is replaced by zsh.
