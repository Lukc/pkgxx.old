0.11.1:
	* New variable available for packagers, PKGMK_PORT.
	  This variable gives the repertory where the port is. So inclusions 
	  of port-specific files is now possible. (for exemple, a script under
	  a different license or common code to recipes with only different 
	  versions)

0.11:
	* A beginning of implementation of scripts in Pkgfile’s functions has
	  been made.
	* Blank lines are removed in the output file of cpp “pkg++”. It is not
	  really noticeable concerning size of the file, but there is no more
	  20 blank lines and things like that…

0.10.2:
	* Corrections of the manual pages which still contained references to
	  pkgmk.
	* The zcompile instruction was broken and has been corrected in the
	  ./configure generated Makefile.
	* The default configuration has been ported from bash to zsh, which has
	  not been done before…

	* Minor documentation updates.
