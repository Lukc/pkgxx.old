.SH NAME
pkg++ \- make software packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpkg++ [options]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpkg++\fP is a \fIpackage management\fP utility, which makes
a software package. A \fIpackage\fP is an archive of files (.pkg.tar.gz)
that can be installed using pkgadd(8).

To prepare to use pkg++, you must write a file named \fIPkgfile\fP
that describes how the package should be build. Once a suitable
\fIPkgfile\fP file exists, each time you change some source files,
you simply execute pkg++ to bring the package up to date. The pkg++
program uses the \fIPkgfile\fP file and the last-modification
times of the source files to decide if the package needs to be updated.

Global build configuration is stored in \fI/etc/pkg++.conf\fP. This
file is read by pkg++ at startup.
